# jsBridge++

** WORK IN PROGRESS ** 

This will be a communications bridge based on websockets++, which will be used to stream games
from a computer (e.g. raspberry pi) to a a browser, e.g. on a Switch.

## TODO
* add tests & CI
* add client type and client app which provides a game
* refactor `Client` and `Bridge`:
    * add some kind of command registration to bridge and client class for maximum flexibility
